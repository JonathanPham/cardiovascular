# SimVascular Python Scripts #

This directory contains scripts for applications using the SimVascular Python Scripting Interface. The SimVascular Python Scripting Interface provides an API for accessing data nodes created by SimVascular modules (e.g. ) from the **SV Data Manager**. For example, the **SV Path Planning** module creates data nodes under the **Paths** entry in the **SV Data Manager**.

The SimVascular Python Scripting Interface is accessed from the GUI by selecting the <img src="images/icon.png" alt="drawing" width="20"/> icon from the SimVascular toolbar. This brings up the **Python Console**. The **Python Console** has two panels providing two modes of operation: 1) **Console** and 2) **Text Edit**. **Console** panel provides a Python interpreter for interactively exexcuting commands to be typed in at the **>>>** prompt.

Selecting the **Text Editor** button at the bottom of the **Python Console** switches to the **Text Edit** panel.

The **Text Edit** panel is used to load, run and edit a Python script stored in a file. Once loaded, the contents of the Python script are displayed and can be run. Python commands can be interactively editied and the contents of the panel rerun. The modified script can then be written to a file.

A Python script file is loaded by selecting the <img src="images/load-script.png" alt="drawing" width="20"/> icon located on the top left of the **Python Console**. The script can then be run by selecting the <img src="images/run-script.png" alt="drawing" width="20"/> icon. Write a modified script to a file by selecting the <img src="images/save-script.png" alt="drawing" width="20"/> icon.


## List of SimVascular Python Scripts ##

[contour_distance.py](contour_distance.py) - This script computes the distance between the centers of two contours
for a segmentation generated by the SimVascular **SV 2D Segmentation** module.
<br><br>
[path_distance.py](path_distance.py) - This script computes the distance between two control points
on a path created by the SimVascular **SV Path Planning** module. **WARNING**: This script will not work with the current SimVascular release because it does not yet have the **GetControlPts()** function implemented.

## Example 1 - Calculating the Distances between Contours for the SimVascular Demo Project
This example demostrates how to use the **contour_distance.py** script to calculating the distances between contours for the SimVascular [Demo Project](http://simvascular.github.io/docsQuickGuide.html#segmentation) which can be downloaded from [here](https://simtk.org/frs/download_confirm.php/file/5113/DemoProject.zip?group_id=930). 

Start SimVascular and open the **Demo Project**. From the **SV Data Manager** select the **aorta** data node under  **Segmentations**. You should now see the panel for the **SV 2D Segmentation** module.

The **Contour List:** displays a list of segmentation contours number 0 to 38.
